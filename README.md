# JSON_request_examples

Welcome to the json_request_examples project! The objective of this project will be to highlight my ability in working with JSON data through the execution of API requests. In this project, I will use Python to execute JSON requests from publicly accessible sources. My aim to showcase my proficiency in handling real-time data, as I recognise it is a crucial skillset in the field of data analytics.

Project Status
The project is currently in its early stages, and I have included a Python notebook file named ONS_json_request.ipynb. This notebook provides a concise example of an request from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) API.
