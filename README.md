# json_request_examples

My goal in this upcoming project is to showcase my proficiency in working with JSON by making API requests, enabling the analysis and visualisation of real-time data. To achieve this, I will use Python to execute JSON requests from publicly accessible sources. The aim is to demonstrate my capability for working with real-time data, which i recognise is an important skillset within data analytics.

A work in progress so I have not uploaded the files yet.
